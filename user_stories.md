// Developer 
As a developer I want to make three photos line up side by side.

I want to be able to click on each photo and track how many times been clicked on.

Track how many times each image has been displayed

Images should not duplicate 

create constructor function that creates an object associated with each image, and has (at a minimum) properties for the name of the image (to be used for display purposes), its filepath, the number of times it has been shown, and the number of times it has been clicked. You'll probably find it useful to create a property that contains a text string you can use as an ID in HTML.

After 25 selections have been made, turn off the event listeners on the images (to prevent additional voting) and also display a list of the products with votes received with each list item looking like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer".
